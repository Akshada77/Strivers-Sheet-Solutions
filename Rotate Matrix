Intuition
Making an another array and directly swapping will work, but it gave array index out of bound exception

Approach
1.Transpose: Make col=row+1 in initializing as the already transposed shouldn't get swapped again
2.Flip:by traversing the array to half the columns only

Complexity
Time complexity:O(n^2)
Space complexity:O(n)
